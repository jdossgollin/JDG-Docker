# jdg_docker

This repository hosts some `Dockerfile`s to attempt to make life easier

- `py3_science` is a build based on `kaggle/python`, which is a fairly complete `anaconda` setup. In addition, some further packages useful for climate science are added, as well as my own `jdgpy` package which has some simple wraparound tools for visualization
- `iri_cpt` is a build, still very preliminary, of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI)'s [Climate Predictability Tool (CPT)](iri.columbia.edu/~awr/wiki/Downscaling/HydroOutlooks/Documents/cpttutorial_june08.html)

# py3_science

This repository hosts a `Docker` build with a full `python` stack for atmospheric science work via `kaggle/python` plus a few useful earth science tools like `netCDF4`.
Because it's built on `kaggle/python`, it's a very heavy (~10GB) build but has most standard scipy and data science libraries already configured.
